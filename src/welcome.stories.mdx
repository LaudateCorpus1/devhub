Welcome to the DevHub Storybook! This is where the front-end developers document our component library.

## Contributing

To contribute, be sure to have the `devhub` repo locally, then add a file with the `.mdx` extension under the `/src` directory.

Check out [this tutorial](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/blob/next/addons/docs/docs/mdx.md#writing-stories) to see how to write stories using **MDX** (JSX-flavored Markdown).
